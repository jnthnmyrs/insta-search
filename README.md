# Instagram Search

2024.03.11

Hello.

Instagram currently only allows for the following of tags. In the past, one could search by keyword and find all the relevant results.

This allows one to search by keyword(s). I haven't yet figured out how to show the latest results, but here we are.

It's all very simple. It takes the input and goes to the instagram url for searching by keyword.

```
https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=${searchTerm}
```

Enjoy!

Searchingly,
Jonathan
